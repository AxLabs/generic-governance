# Example of a Governance Smart Contract for the Neo Blockchain

This code is the product of the [Neo DevLog Episode 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9V_hADZJPI) 
held on Dec 16, 2021 on the Neo Discord Server.
It shows a simple implementation of a governance contract that handles proposals with
arbitrary intents. At the same time it serves as an example of how to use the neow3j test
framework (at version 3.14.1). 

> Note: Neow3j might have evolved since the creation of this repository.
