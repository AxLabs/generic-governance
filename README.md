# A generic governance sample for Neo in Java

This code is the product of the [Neo DevLog Episode 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9V_hADZJPI) 
held on Dec 16, 2021 on the Neo Discord Server.
It shows a simple implementation of a governance contract (or DAO) that handles proposals with
arbitrary intents. At the same time it serves as an example of how to use the neow3j test
framework (at version 3.14.1). Beware, that neow3j might have evolved a lot at the time that you
find this repository. So, make sure to also check out the [neow3j](https://github.com/neow3j/neow3j)
repository.
